  "title": "Grumet: We Must Seize this Opportunity in the Immigration Border Discussion",
  "date": "Saturday, January 19, 2019",
  "content": "Washington, D.C.– The following is a statement from Jason Grumet, president of the Bipartisan Policy Center, on today’s developments in the border policy negotiations.“Today’s developments are encouraging. President Trump appears willing to broaden the immigration discussion to include consideration of some Democratic priorities.“The administration is surely aware that the initial offer of temporary protection for DREAMers is unlikely to garner bipartisan support. However, the step toward a balanced solution that combines increased border security with protection for DREAMers and those who have enjoyed Temporary Protected Status is the right direction to improve our broken immigration system and a plausible approach to ending this damaging standoff.“Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic caucus must seize this opportunity and respond to the White House with a specific counter proposal. With constructive negotiation underway, Congress should move to immediately reopen the federal government.”KEYWORDS: DREAMERS, GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN, IMMIGRATION, JASON GRUMET, NANCY PELOSI, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP"
